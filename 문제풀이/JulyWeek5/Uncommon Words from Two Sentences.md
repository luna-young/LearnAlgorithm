- [문제](https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/)
   - We are given two sentences A and B.  
   (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)
   A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.
   Return a list of all uncommon words. 
   
   You may return the list in any order.

    - Example 1:
      - Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
      - Output: ["sweet","sour"]

    - Example 2:
      - Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
      - Output: ["banana"]
      - Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
      
    - Note
      1. 0 <= A.length <= 200
      2. 0 <= B.length <= 200
      3. A and B both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
